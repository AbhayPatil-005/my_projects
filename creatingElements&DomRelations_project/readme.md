## 🛠️ DOM Manipulation: Dynamic Content Insertion

In this section of the project, I practiced dynamic DOM manipulation using JavaScript:

### ✅ Key Features:

- Accessed all `<div>` elements using `getElementsByTagName()`.
- Created a new `<h3>` subheading with text using `createElement()` and `textContent`.
- Inserted the subheading right below the main heading using `.insertBefore()` with `.nextSibling`.
- Styled the subheading to appear in italic.
- Created a new paragraph element `<p>` with the text "Total fruits: 4".
- Inserted the paragraph before the unordered list `<ul>`.
- Assigned an `id` to the paragraph using `setAttribute()` for easier future access.

This helped strengthen my understanding of:
- Creating and appending new elements
- Positioning elements accurately in the DOM
- Applying styles and attributes via JavaScript
- Navigating and manipulating parent-child relationships in HTML structure

🎯 **Goal**: Build confidence in working with the JavaScript DOM to create interactive and dynamic webpages.
