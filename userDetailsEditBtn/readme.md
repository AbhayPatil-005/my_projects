# 📝 User Management Form (LocalStorage + DOM)

This project is a simple user management form built using **HTML, JavaScript, and localStorage**. It allows users to:

- Add user details (name, email, phone)
- Display the list of users on the screen
- Edit a user’s information
- Delete a user
- Ensure data using `localStorage` so it stays after refreshing
- Maintain edit state temporarily using `sessionStorage`

## 📁 Features

- **Add User**: Enter user details and submit the form to add them to the list.
- **Edit User**: Click the **Edit** button beside any user to load their data into the form. Update and save it.
- **Delete User**: Remove a user from the list and localStorage by clicking **Delete**.
- **Data Persistence**: Users are stored in `localStorage` so data is retained even after page refresh.
- **Edit State Memory**: Uses `sessionStorage` to remember which user is being edited.
